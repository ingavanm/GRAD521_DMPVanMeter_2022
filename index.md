# PFAS Research Data Management Plan

# Research overview 
My overall research is involved with the large class of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas), how they affect and alter the environment and animals, and how we can extract/retrieve them from the environment. My current research topic, however, is focused on perfluoroalkyl betaines and how to remove them from soil sediment. Perfluoroalkyl betaines are straight chained per-fluorinated substances with a betaine headgroup. Betaines are a class of compounds that contain a positively charged nitrogen directly connected to a carbonyl group with a negatively charged oxygen. These compounds dissolve semi-readily in aqueous phases but have a very high sorption factor, so they are found on almost any surface they come into contact with. The main question that the microbiologist from Texas A&M University and I are trying to answer is: **can we remove these perfluoroalkyl betaines from soil sediment, and how?**

# Data description
The type of data we need comes in two phases: the first phase is data on the soil we will be using for our tests. We need to know if there is any trace pfas compounds in the soil before spiking with our pfas standards, we need the pH of the soil, the carbon and nitrogen content of the soil, the particle size(s) of the soil, the cationic exchange capacity, and lastly the dominant mineral type of the soil. This data is in the formats of:

-Excel files
-Word Docs
-Physical soil samples

This data was found previously by one of my lab mates and is less than 1 GB in size. The phsycial soil samples are held in-house until the research project is finished. 

The second phase is data from the liquid/liquid extraction that would take place to determine if the microbiologists at Texas A&M successfully pulled any perfluoroalkyl betaines out of the soil or not. This data will be in the formats of:

-Raw wiff files from the Liquid Chromatogram (LC) and Mass Spectrometer (MS) (LC/MS)
-Processed data files 

And this data will consist of large datasets, upwards of 50-100 samples (5-10 GB) and will be focused on the organic layer extracted from the aqueous phase. The raw wiff files are the file output produced by the LC/MS, and includes the chromatographs and spectra readouts from the LC and MS. These raw wiff files are transformed into manageable outputs utilizing our processing system.

The goal is that these betaine compounds will move from the aqueous layer to the organic layer after the addition of salt, and possibly an acid or base, to the aqueous phase. These extracted samples will then be run on an LC/MS with a general targeted pfas method. The data collected from the LC/MS analysis will be saved onto an online folder that the whole lab can access. 

# Roles and Resposiblities
The data that I produce from my end of the project is managed by myself and my PI. 
My PI is responsible for:

-Implementation of the DMP

I am responsible for:

-Data produced regarding the perfluoroalkyl betaines
-Physical soil samples 
-Data from LC/S
-Processed data 

It is solely my responsibility to save the data onto the computer, upload it to the processing computer, and to save it onto the labs shared drive, which is where we put all our data, project information, etc. that is shared with every member of the lab to access. This process is not automatic, and in fact is fully manual done by myself only. 

# Data standrds and metadata
The metadata produced through this research will be from:

-Method information
-Liquid chromatogram (LC) and Mass Spectrometer (MS) system parameters 
-Definitions 
-Units and their definitions 
-Information pertaining to where the physical soil samples came from

There are not any current metadata standards that would work with the metadata I produce. 

The data files produced from this research will follow the format of (dd/mm/yy), but other than that, the data doesn't have any data standards to follow. 

# Storage and security
The data being produced by me is not sensitive or need to be protected. It is just data on the compounds. The plan that my colleagues at Texas A&M came up with does need to be protected however. 
The data is stored in three different places for this project. The movement of data from computer to computer is manual, and is done solely by me. 

The drive, which is where the final processed data is located, is backed up every 12 hours. Along with the backup of the drive every 12 hours, my lab also has external hard drives that we upload the whole drive to every few months. These external hard drives are stored in a lockbox and are only used if data accidentally gets deleted, or we have a breach of the system. I also save the processed data onto my personal computer. So, in total I have anywhere from two to three copies of the processed data, and 4-5 copies of the raw data. When students graduate, their data is still in the drive untouched for anyone/everyone to utilize. 
The data for this project is generated from the very beginning of the project, through to the very end. I organize the data utilizing excel sheets and word docs that I organize by project folders in our drive. Inside of those project folders are subfolders, which are labeled with project information (where metadata is stored), raw data, and processed data, which is how I keep track of different versions of my data.

# Access and data sharing
Since the data I produce is just data on the compounds, it canâ€™t be protected or copyrighted. Therefore, my data has no limitations on what I can share, or who I can share it with. The data will be made publicly available once the research is published, or beforehand if someone requests it.

The data will be made publicly available at the time of publication, or beforehand if someone requests it. The publication will be in a scientific journal and most of the data will be contained in the article as graphs, figures, or tables. The formats for the data that is not found in the article will be excel sheets, word docs, tables/graphs/figures made from programming applications (like R), etc. and this data will be contained in the Supplemental Information (sometimes referred to as Supplemental Materials) section. This Supplemental Information section is often a separate document, of which the format is typically a Word document or an Adobe document. Besides the data being made available in the publication, the data can also be shared directly to someone if they cannot access it, so long as they contact us about it. 

# Archiving and preservation
All the data produced in my research group is collected onto our drive. This is a shared drive that everyone in the research group has access to. The data is archived and preserved anywhere from 5-10 years after graduation, unless all the data is accessible through the publication (which most of the time it is). In that case, the research group removes that data from the drive after the data is published and leaves it up to the individual to preserve it if they wish. Access to data that is archived is available to anyone who has permission to the research groups drive, which is present and past members for up to a year after graduation. The types of data that is archived will be raw wiff-file data from the LC/MS, excel sheets containing datasets and calculations, and full publications once they research is published.

"Data management plan for PFAS research"

PFAS stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and they're known for their oil and water repelling capabilities, high thermal stabilities, and high surfactant properties. 
This DMP is focused on the research project with microbiologists from Texas A&M university, which involves observing and understanding how a class of PFAS (polyfluoro betains) behave in soil.
